  title: CurbIQ's Curb API
  description: >-
    This is CurbIQ's ⚡*Curb API*⚡ to access curb demand and supply data in the 
    Open Mobility Foundation's Curb Data Specification (CDS) format.
    
    The API provides access to curb supply, curb policies, real-time curb occupancy data, and
    hourly metrics on curb usage by zone, area, or space. The API is secured with
    an API key, which is provided to you when you register for the API.

    👩‍💻 To request access to the API, please contact CurbIQ at [contact@curbiq.io]
    with the following included in the subject line: "Curb API Access Request".
